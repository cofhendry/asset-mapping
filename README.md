# Asset Mapping

Hello Visitors! Clarke here. This is a new repo to share a little more about the participatory asset mapping project I am working on.

# Context

Resource guides have been iterated throughout communities for decades. They come in many different forms, from paper booklets and pocket guides to tediously detailed Excel documents. In thinking about ways to iterate a guide to not only have maximum reach potential, but also community voice and data ownership, the idea of geospatial mapmaking emerged. 

Through a learning curve of the GeoJSON documentation format, the assets were collectively mapped.
